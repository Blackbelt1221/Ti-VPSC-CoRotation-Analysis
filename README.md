The developers thank Oliver J. Woodford and Yair M. Altman for the development of export_fig, which has been used extensively in this work to create publication quality figures and gifs. We also thank Víctor Martínez-Cagigal for customcolormap and DGM for blendtools, both tools found on the Matlab File Exchange. These excellent tools provided several solutions to problems that might have otherwise gone unsolved.
